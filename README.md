Wedding Weight Planner, (WWP)

Heroku app url: https://wwp-305-project.herokuapp.com

Main Idea:
---------------------------
Helps user set a daily calorie budget and make the full calendar until user hit the goal.

• SEffective: Chose goal base on the even, and set the based on the proven principles of calorie.

• Personal: Set your goals and achieve them on your terms.

• The Formula for Losing Weight:  Harris Benedict gives a pretty good idea of how many calories you should consume to stay at your current weight. Because a pound of fat equals about 3,500 calories, cutting 500 calories a day will mean one pound lost in a week, a reasonable amount.

  But eating less isn't the only way to slim down. To lose 500 calories a day, you also can cut calories by 250 and add a workout that burns 250 calories.

• The Formula of calculate BMR : 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds ) + (4.7 x height in inches ) - (4.7 x age).

• In the funture, this app will add active chosing:

Sedentary: BMR x 1.2.

Lightly active (light exercise one to three days a week): BMR x 1.375.

Moderately active (moderate exercise three to five days per week): BMR x 1.55.

Very active (vigorous exercise six to seven days a week): BMR x 1.725.

Extremely active (intense exercise or sports training six to seven days per week): BMR x 1.9.
