Main Idea:
---------------------------
Helps user set a daily calorie budget and make the full calendar until user hit the goal.

SEffective: Chose goal base on the even, and set the based on the proven principles of calorie.

Personal: Set your goals and achieve them on your terms.

The Formula for Losing Weight:  Harris Benedict gives a pretty good idea of how many calories you should consume to stay at your current weight. Because a pound of fat equals about 3,500 calories, cutting 500 calories a day will mean one pound lost in a week, a reasonable amount.

But eating less isn't the only way to slim down. To lose 500 calories a day, you also can cut calories by 250 and add a workout that burns 250 calories.

The formula: 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds ) + (4.7 x height in inches ) - (4.7 x age).
